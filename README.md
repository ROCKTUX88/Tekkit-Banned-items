Tekkit-Banned-items
===================

This is a Minecraft 1.2.5 plugin that when you run the commands it will check the config file and tell the player the banned items on the server and you can also add a reason to why.  Version 1.0 of this plugin (for Minecraft 1.2.5) is still in beta but I have found np problems with this plugin and it runs very smooth, fast, and does not require hardly any rescources/setup.
